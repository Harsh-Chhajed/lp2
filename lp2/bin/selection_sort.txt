Certainly! Here are some possible questions and answers for a viva related to the Selection Sort algorithm:

Q1: What is the Selection Sort algorithm?
A1: The Selection Sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion of an array and placing it at the beginning of the sorted portion.

Q2: How does the Selection Sort algorithm work?
A2: The Selection Sort algorithm works by dividing the input array into two parts: the sorted portion and the unsorted portion. In each iteration, it finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element, expanding the sorted portion by one element.

Q3: What is the time complexity of the Selection Sort algorithm?
A3: The time complexity of the Selection Sort algorithm is O(n^2), where 'n' is the number of elements in the array. It has a nested loop structure that compares each element with the remaining elements in the unsorted portion.

Q4: Does Selection Sort have any advantages?
A4: Selection Sort has a few advantages: it is simple to implement, it performs well for small arrays or partially sorted arrays, and it has low space complexity since it sorts the elements in-place.

Q5: What are the main steps involved in the Selection Sort algorithm?
A5: The main steps of the Selection Sort algorithm are as follows:
   1. Find the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array.
   2. Swap the minimum element with the first unsorted element.
   3. Expand the sorted portion by one element.
   4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the entire array is sorted.

Q6: Can the Selection Sort algorithm be used for sorting in descending order?
A6: Yes, the Selection Sort algorithm can be modified to sort in descending order by finding the maximum element instead of the minimum element and placing it at the beginning of the sorted portion.

Q7: Is Selection Sort stable?
A7: No, the Selection Sort algorithm is not stable. Stability refers to maintaining the relative order of elements with equal values during the sorting process. Selection Sort does not guarantee the stability of elements with equal values.

These are just a few example questions to help you prepare for a viva on the Selection Sort algorithm. Feel free to expand upon these or explore additional concepts related to the algorithm.
