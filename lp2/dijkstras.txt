Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm used to find the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph. It efficiently computes the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in the graph. Here's a detailed explanation of Dijkstra's algorithm:

1. Initialize:
   - Assign a distance value to each vertex in the graph. Initialize the distance value of the source vertex as 0 and the distance value of all other vertices as infinity.
   - Create an empty set to store visited vertices.
   - Create a priority queue or a min-heap to store vertices and their corresponding distances.

2. Main Loop:
   - Repeat the following steps until all vertices are visited:
     - Select the vertex with the minimum distance from the priority queue. Initially, this will be the source vertex.
     - Mark the selected vertex as visited and remove it from the priority queue.
     - For each adjacent vertex to the selected vertex, calculate the distance through the selected vertex.
     - If the distance calculated is smaller than the current distance value of the adjacent vertex, update its distance value.
     - Add the updated vertex and its distance to the priority queue.

3. Termination:
   - Once all vertices are visited or the destination vertex is reached, the algorithm terminates.

4. Output:
   - The shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex is determined by the distance values assigned during the execution of the algorithm.
   - Additionally, the algorithm can provide the predecessor (parent) of each vertex, which allows tracing back the shortest path.

Dijkstra's algorithm guarantees to find the shortest path from the source vertex to all other vertices as long as the graph does not contain negative-weight edges. It works by iteratively selecting the vertex with the smallest distance, relaxing its adjacent vertices, and gradually expanding the shortest path tree until all vertices are visited.

By using a priority queue or a min-heap, Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently selects the vertex with the minimum distance at each step, reducing the overall time complexity.

It's worth mentioning that if you only need to find the shortest path between two specific vertices, you can terminate the algorithm as soon as the destination vertex is reached, instead of visiting all vertices.

Dijkstra's algorithm has numerous applications, including route planning in transportation networks, network routing, and resource allocation.
